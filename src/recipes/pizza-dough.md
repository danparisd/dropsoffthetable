In a stand mixer with dough hook attached, add all ingredients and mix on med to med-high speed for 20 minutes. Split and shape into 2 500 gram balls and rise overnight in the refrigerator.

Preheat an oven and a pizza steel or pizza stone for at least 1 hour to 550F or as hot as your oven will go.

Coat balls in semola flour, and turn out onto a flat surface and firmly press the balls down into disks with finger tips, making sure to pop all large bubbles. On a pizza peel, stretch dough using whatever technique works for you so that the center is relatively thin and the outer edge is slightly thicker. It should be about 18 inches across. Add sauce, cheese, and toppings. Gently shake and shimmy the pizza onto the hot pizza stone and cook until crust is deep brown or cheese is about to split.

High gluten flour is crucial to this recipe. If you can find "Gold Medal All Trumps" Flour, use that. If you want to use King Arthur bread flour, you'll need to use 540g KA Bread flour and 10g vital wheat gluten.

For best results, use fresh grated Low Moisture Whole Milk Mozzerella cheese. If you can find Grande brand, use that, it's fantastic and pre-shredded. If not, you can use Galbani string cheese and just chop it up or shred it with a food processor.
