1 cup of rice make about 2 servings, but you can make as much rice as your seive will hold once cooked. For dry rice, don't fill the seive more than half way to the top of the seive.

Bring water to boil on the stove. Enough to cover the rice by an inch or two

Rinse rice

Add rice to boiling water and boil for 3 minutes

Drain rice through a metal seive into a heat proof container, saving hot water.

Leave rice in the seive and add two inches of the hot water back to the pot and return to a boil on the stove

Place seive with rice on the pot with the boiling water, cover seive and pot with a lid or aluminum foil and steam for 15 minutes.

Spoon rice from seive to a plate or bowl and serve or use for fried rice
