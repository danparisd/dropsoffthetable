W﻿hisk or shake all ingredients together. Allow to sit for several hours (or days) for flavors to blend.  If using "live" cider vinegar, store this in the fridge or heat it up to pasteurize so it doesn't ferment.

Use as a mop for pork BBQ or as a dip at serving.

H﻿ot Sauce, sugar, and ketchup amounts may need tweaking. ketchup might should be tomato paste instead.
